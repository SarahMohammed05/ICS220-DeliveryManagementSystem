# ICS220-DeliveryManagementSystem

## Overview
This repository contains the code, diagrams, and documentation for ICS220 Assignment 1, a Delivery Management System. It demonstrates OOP principles and UML design for a delivery company managing orders, details, and notes.

## Project Description
The system handles delivery orders, manages logistics (e.g., package dimensions, weight, method), and generates delivery notes, based on the assignment sample.

## Repository Structure


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Lucidchart (or similar) for UML diagrams

## Usage
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sarahmohammed/ICS220-DeliveryManagementSystem.git`
2. Run `delivery_system.py` to test classes and generate a sample delivery note.
3. View UML diagrams in `diagrams/`.

## Python Code
`code/delivery_system.py` includes well-documented classes (Customer, Order, Delivery, Item) with constructors, 5+ attributes, setters/getters, and implemented methods for validation, calculation, and status updates.

## UML Diagrams
- Use-Case Diagram: Shows actors (Customer, Delivery System) and use-cases (Place Order, Manage Details, Generate Note).
- Class Diagram: Models classes, attributes, methods, and relationships with access specifiers.

## Submission
The PDF report in `docs/` references this repo for Python code, includes UML diagrams, and provides a summary of learnings. Ensure the repo is public with commit history.
